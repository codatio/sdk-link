## Configure your auth flow

Our Link settings allow you to configure the authorization process based on your data needs and white-label Embedded Link to suit your brand. You can customize these settings in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/) in [Settings > Auth flow > Link](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings).

Refer to our documentation to see how you can [customize Embedded Link](https://docs.codat.io/auth-flow/customize/customize-link).
<h2 id='create-company'>Create a new company</h2>

These examples require you to have previously created a company and retrieved its `companyId`. For purposes of sample projects, you can do this via [Portal](https://app.codat.io/). In your codat solution you would do it via API.
